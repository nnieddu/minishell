The goal of the minishell project is to recode our own small implementation of Bash. 
Bash is a type of interpreter that processes shell commands. 
A shell interpreter takes commands in plain text format and calls Operating System services to do something. 
Bash is the improved version of Sh (Bourne Shell).

This project was carried out in collaboration with Joel Benassac (jobenass, https://github.com/jobenass).
